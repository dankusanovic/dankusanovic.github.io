  abstract={ The paper presents an efficient methodology to carry out reliability-based structural optimisation of non-linear systems under stochastic loading. The optimisation problem is formulated as the minimisation of an objective function subject to multiple reliability constraints. The reliability constraints are given in terms of first excursion probabilities with large state-space dimensions. A sequential approximate optimisation scheme based on global approximations of the reliability constraints is implemented in the proposed formulation. The approximations of the first excursion probabilities in terms of the design variables are constructed by combining a global mixed linearisation approach with a reliability sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity of the first excursion probabilities are estimated by considering some statistics of an augmented reliability problem. The number of reliability estimations required during the optimal design process is generally very small. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.},

In particular a Bayesian model updating approach based on a stochastic simulation method is considered in the present formulation. Stochastic simulation techniques require a large number of finite element model re-analyses to be performed over the space of model parameters during the updating process. Substructure coupling techniques for dynamic analysis are proposed to reduce the computational cost involved in the dynamic re-analyses. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated with identification and model updating applications for finite element building models using simulated seismic response data."

In particular base-isolated buildings under uncertain excitation are considered in this work. A probabilistic logic approach is adopted for considering the variability of future excitations. Isolation elements composed by rubber bearings are used in the present formulation. The non-linear behavior of the bearings is characterized by a biaxial hysteretic model which is calibrated with experimental data. The performance of the isolated system is defined in terms of the isolators deformations and the superstructure interstory drifts and absolute accelerations.

abstract = "This paper presents a procedure for obtaining compromise designs of structural systems under stochastic excitation. In particular, an effective strategy for determining specific Pareto optimal solutions is implemented. The design goals are defined in terms of deterministic performance functions and/or performance functions involving reliability measures. The associated reliability problems are characterized by means of a large number of uncertain parameters (hundreds or thousands). The designs are obtained by formulating a compromise programming problem which is solved by a first-order interior point algorithm. The sensitivity information required by the proposed solution strategy is estimated by an approach that combines an advanced simulation technique with local approximations of some of the quantities associated with structural performance. An efficient Pareto sensitivity analysis with respect to the design variables becomes possible with the proposed formulation. Such information is used for decision making and tradeoff analysis. Numerical validations show that only a moderate number of stochastic analyses (reliability estimations) has to be performed in order to find compromise designs. Two example problems are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

abstract="The recent improvements in isolation system products have led to the design and construction of an increasing number of seismically isolated buildings worldwide (Ceccoli et al. 1999, Chopra 1995, Kelly 1986, Zou et al. 2010). Similarly, seismic isolation has been extensively used for seismic retrofitting of existing buildings (DeLuca et al. 2001, Mokha et al. 1996). In addition, base isolation concepts are utilized for the protection from shock and vibration of sensitive components of critical facilities such as hospitals, nuclear reactors, industrial and data center facilities. One of the difficulties in the analysis and design of base-isolated systems has been the explicit consideration of the non-linear behavior of the isolators. Another challenge has been the efficient prediction of the dynamic response under future ground motions considering their potential variability as well as competing objectives related to the protection of the superstructure and the minimization of base displacement. The objective of this work is to characterize the performance of base-isolated systems from a reliability point of view. In particular, the case of large scale building models is considered here. Isolation systems composed by rubber bearings are used in the present formulation. The non-linear behavior of these devices is characterized by a biaxial hysteretic model which is calibrated with experimental data (Yamamoto et al. 2009). First excursion probabilities are used as measures of the system reliability.",
