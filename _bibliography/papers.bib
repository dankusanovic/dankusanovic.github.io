  abstract={ The paper presents an efficient methodology to carry out reliability-based structural optimisation of non-linear systems under stochastic loading. The optimisation problem is formulated as the minimisation of an objective function subject to multiple reliability constraints. The reliability constraints are given in terms of first excursion probabilities with large state-space dimensions. A sequential approximate optimisation scheme based on global approximations of the reliability constraints is implemented in the proposed formulation. The approximations of the first excursion probabilities in terms of the design variables are constructed by combining a global mixed linearisation approach with a reliability sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity of the first excursion probabilities are estimated by considering some statistics of an augmented reliability problem. The number of reliability estimations required during the optimal design process is generally very small. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.},

abstract = "This paper presents a procedure for obtaining compromise designs of structural systems under stochastic excitation. In particular, an effective strategy for determining specific Pareto optimal solutions is implemented. The design goals are defined in terms of deterministic performance functions and/or performance functions involving reliability measures. The associated reliability problems are characterized by means of a large number of uncertain parameters (hundreds or thousands). The designs are obtained by formulating a compromise programming problem which is solved by a first-order interior point algorithm. The sensitivity information required by the proposed solution strategy is estimated by an approach that combines an advanced simulation technique with local approximations of some of the quantities associated with structural performance. An efficient Pareto sensitivity analysis with respect to the design variables becomes possible with the proposed formulation. Such information is used for decision making and tradeoff analysis. Numerical validations show that only a moderate number of stochastic analyses (reliability estimations) has to be performed in order to find compromise designs. Two example problems are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
